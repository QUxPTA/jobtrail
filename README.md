<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align='center'>
In my days of freelancing, I once got a client whom I helped with a number of tasks as his virtual assistant. One such task was applying to jobs and filling in the job application details in a spreadsheet he had prepared. What intrigued me most, was how the email part would update dynamically, if the email was read, bounced or pending.Coming to the end of my software engineering journey, I feel empowered to build one such tool that achieves such functionality among a horde of others. This, I believe will help not only I, but the entire ALX community as we go into yet another phase of our lives. A phase of making job applications.
